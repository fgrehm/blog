      <description>A while ago I stumbled across this benchmark by Brandon Liu on StackMachine&amp;rsquo;s blog comparing the numbers for performing some typical tasks on his physical machine and doing the same thing using virtual machines.
The measurements were made using Discourse and compared the numbers of doing things on VirtualBox and VMware Fusion so I got curious to see how well vagrant-lxc shared folders would perform. What I ended up finding is that it seems that Discourse provides a base box that was configured by hand and the Chef cookbooks used only deal with some basic stuff and I&amp;rsquo;d have to either do things by hand or write some provisioning scripts on my own.</description>
