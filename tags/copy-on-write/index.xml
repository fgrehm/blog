      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot with Docker recently and while learning more about it I came across &amp;ldquo;Another Union File System&amp;rdquo; (AUFS) + its Copy On Write (COW) capabilities and have been pretty impressed by it. In short, by using a COW + union file system Docker makes things really cheap when it comes to disk usage.
The idea of COW filesystems along with a couple GitHub issues, some tweets exchanged with @rcarmo and this post on improvements made on lxc-clone was enough to trigger my interest on BTRFS and I went out to learn more about it.</description>
