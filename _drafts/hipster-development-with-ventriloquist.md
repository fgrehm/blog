CHANGE TO USE DEEVSTEP!!


Have you ever thought of mixing Golang, Ruby and node.js on the same project?
What about relying on RethinkDB, ElasticSearch, Redis and memcached to build it?
Have you ever seen so many _buzzwords_ on a single post? :P

Jokes apart, I've noticed that many people do not realize that [Ventriloquist]()
can be used to build <s>hipster</s> complex development environments with
_zero pain_ and to showcase that I've put together a [Gist]()-like
app that uses _everything_ I mentioned above and some other frontend goodies.
