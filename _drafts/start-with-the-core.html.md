* Get it "right" from start
* Avoid unecessary discussions about silly stuff (this field should come before that one or this button should be green)
* "core" == what distinguishes your app from others, diferencial
* DDD
* The "rest", use activeadmin, scaffolds, whatever
* seedbank
* use [DCI](), [Mixins](), [DDD "stuff"]() or whatever, just make sure the core is "right", well modelled and more important: tested!
