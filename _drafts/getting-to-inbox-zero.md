* One step at a time (started on Jan 27)

* gunsub
  * side effect of unwatching the project on github (but keeping a star :P)
  * addicted to gh timeline
  * will never miss out on an issue again :P
  * makes timeline clean?

* Consolidate things you need to do on a single place
  Sources:
    * Emails
    * trello
    * pivotal
    * post its
    * calendar

* Chronology
  1) Dump everything into a single list
  2) Start tracking what you've done
  3) When it grows too big, start categorizing and prioritizing things
  4) Keep track of things accomplished by the date
  5) Always write down the date on the separate gist so that if you forget about updating you can remember when was it :P
  6) TODAY -> Backlog -> DUMP -> CHANGELOG
  7) Keep a Radar of things you can't forget or need everyday remembering

* Why build a tool?
  * Copy & pasting strings is error prone
  * Lost stuff along the way
  * Restrictions
  * Not machine friendly

* Priorize and categorize entries after everything is on a single place

* Lembrar q apesar do pocket ter sido chamado readitlater, pode ser utilizado tanto para isso como bookmark de posts como o antigo delicious

* Tags, favorites and archive

* Repeat after me: "I shall not keep browser tabs with articles to read open"
  - Make it visible

* Keep categories on feedly down to a minimum, blogs are usually about many different subjects, don't waste your time like I did trying to categorize them
  * Kept only the "Humor", ... around

* Better do as we go?

* Pocket should be the only source of reading!!!!

* Flow:
  * Feedly, twitter, newsletter
    * Constantly review feedly stuff, if many uninteresting posts in a row, unsubscribe
  * Get them on pocket with the appropriate tags
  * Delete if not worth keeping around
  * Rinse and repeat

* Pragmatic
  * Went trough the list and removed

* INformation overload

* read about inbox zero

* remote developer, need to stay focused, previous experience...

* tag from the beggining (its boring to do afterwards)
  * Keep a set of tags somewhere during the process?

* dont go crazy and try to get to it in a day, it will take a lot of time depending on the stuff you'll have around

* reserve time to get to read pocket stuff every day (make it a recurring task)

* opened browser tabs

* Keep track of things on a gist
  * link to original
  * Falar de acumular as iteracoes, olhar historico do gist
  * I'm adapting it to my own needs and will hopefully get to talk about it on another post
  * Gollum(?)
  * recurring tasks
    * remporary recurring tasks
    * list examples

* Keep track of reading list on pocket (need to tag things, otherwise it will be a PITA to read as will be switching context between posts)

* Start with email
  * Lots of:
    * links to blog posts that went to pocket
    * links to github projects that people shared on twitter that I wanted to check out later (they were either starred or added to pocket)
    * newletters, forums, github trending.... things with links that also went to pocket
    * github notifications that required my attention / action
    * remiders
  * Generated lots of tasks on my todo list

* clean up feed reader subscriptions

* Offload everything to pocket

* save some time everyday to read things on pocket, make it primary source for reading stuff

* likeastore for finding projects / tweets that came into my attention

* clean up blog drafts (another type inbox, maybe there should be a section about that on the beggining of the post?)

* get things on a single place / source of information
  * email
  * trello braindump
  * lista no celular
  * be pragmatic: "I won't read an article / check out a project from outside pocket", dont worry if you miss out on something that is trending, you'll get back to it afterwards

* Tags and categories everywhere
  * http://www.zemanta.com/blog/your-blog-needs-tags-4-tips-how-to-use-them-effectively/ for blogs but it helped out
  * 1 category per link, max 5 tags
  * pocket
  * feedly
  * make them consistent
  * mind map on paper with a pencil and an eraser next to you then make it digital (put on a app or take a picture of it to keep around)
    * connect related tags
    * time boxed (30 minutes ?)
