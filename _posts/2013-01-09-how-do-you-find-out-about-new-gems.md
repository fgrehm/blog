I've [recently](https://rubygems.org/gems/letter_opener_web)
[released](https://rubygems.org/gems/rake-notes)
[a few](https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-notify)
[gems](https://rubygems.org/gems/tiny-rails) and without any "advertisement" I
found out that a lot of people were actually using them. As of this writing,
one has 560+ downloads and the other 3 have 160+ downloads. I know it is not a
big number compared to Rails' [20+ million](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails)
but is still a significant amount of downloads given that I have not twitted
or wrote a blog post about them (although I plan to ;)

This made me think about how others are keeping up to date with the RubyGems
"ecossystem". I know that [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) has a
[twitter account](http://twitter.com/rubygems) but given it's huge number of
updates, seems kinda hard to use it as single a source of "new goodies".

In my case, I keep looking into my Github news feed to find out what other
users are starring / forking. [A fresh cup](http://afreshcup.com/) is another
great source of information and my coworkers at [Codeminer42](http://www.codeminer42.com)
also do a great job on our internal mailing lists keeping everyone updated with
exciting new gems out there.

What about you? How do you find out about new gems?
