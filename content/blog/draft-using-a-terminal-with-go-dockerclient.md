Rewrite of devstep cli, make it more robust, better evolve, add tests...
devstep deserve a post of its own that is on the works
Couldnt make it work
Figured out
Didn't work properly (arrows, ctrl+c, ....)
Had a look at python libs
Found out about dockerpty
Digged into docker code
Found out about term package
Still had trouble with detecting that container had stopped
Channels, separate thread solution that is hacky but works
Released as a go lib
